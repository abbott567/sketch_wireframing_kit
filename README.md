## About the wireframing kit
Quick sketchapp wireframing tool for UK government digital services

The Sketch wireframing kit provides a way to make static prototypes that look like pages on GOVUK. These wireframes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

It includes components and patterns from the [GOVUK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk "GOV.UK Design System")

The wireframing kit no longer supports mobile components from version 3.0. If you have a need for this let me know in the issues.
